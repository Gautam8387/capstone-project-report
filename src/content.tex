\section{Scope \& Boundaries}
\subsection{Scope}
\lettrine{T}{ }his project focuses on the development of a department-specific Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for the Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition at AIIMS, New Delhi. The primary goal of the system is to support the initial evaluation of patients presenting with abdominal pain.\\[\baselineskip]

\noindent The system does not autonomously diagnose patients. Instead, it provides probable diagnoses and suggests a possible organ of origin. Final diagnostic authority remains with the physician, who can audit and modify the system's suggestions based on clinical judgment. It has Autonomous Decision-Making and follows a human-in-the-loop approach.

\subsection{Boundaries}
\lettrine{T}{ }he system is limited to the initial evaluation and probable diagnosis of abdominal pain and does not any other components from abdominal pain evaluation pipeline. It is tailored to the Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition's protocol for abdominal pain at AIIMS, New Delhi, and does not generalize to other medical departments or conditions. Additionally, the system does not make final diagnostic decisions, as the ultimate responsibility for diagnosis rests with the physician.
