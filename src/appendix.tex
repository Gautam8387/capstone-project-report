\section{Probable Diagnosis and Organ of Origin}
\label{appendix:organs_of_origin}
Given below is a table mapping the 19 organs of origin to the 29 probable diagnoses. The Table \ref{tab:organs_of_origin} is structured such that each row corresponds to a organ of origin, and each value in column \texttt{Probable Diagnoses} corresponds to a (list of) probable diagnosis(es) that can originate from that organ.
